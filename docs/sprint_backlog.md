## Sprint backlog

The Sprint Backlog page is a central hub for project participants, offering a clear breakdown of sprint-specific tasks and user stories:

- **Sprint information**

  - At the top, users find a concise summary of the sprint, including its title, duration, and a convenient button to navigate back to the Product Backlog. This section sets the context for the sprint, outlining the timeframe and providing a quick link for easy access to broader project details.

- **Tasks and user stories breakdown**

  - The core of the page is dedicated to detailing the user stories within the sprint, along with their associated tasks. Each story is listed with options for deeper exploration or task creation, subject to the user's role and the story's completion status. Tasks are categorized by their current state: Unassigned, Assigned, Active, or Done, making it easy to gauge progress and workload at a glance. If a task has been assigned but not accepted by the user, it is displayed in the "Unassigned" section with a pending status.

  - The user story tasks are displayed in a table format for each user story, with each row representing a task. The columns in the table include the task name, the user assigned to the task, the initial time estimate of the task, the logged time for the task, the remaining time for the task, and the status of the task. A task can be inspected by clicking on the **details** icon (...) and can also be edited and deleted if not active or assigned.

### Managing tasks

- **Assign task**

  - A task that has no user assigned to it can be taken up by clicking on the Assign button next to the “Assigned to” column in the user story tables on the Sprint backlog page. Additionally, a project member can designate any user to a task via the task’s creation or edit menu.

- **Unassign task**

  - A user assigned to a task has the option to unassign themselves from it by clicking on the **Unassign button** next to the "Assigned to" table rows in the user story tabels in the Sprint backlog page. After unassigning, a new **Assign button** appears, which allows a new user to assign the task to themselves.

- **Accept/reject**

  - If a user has been assigned to a task by another team member, they can either accept or reject this assignment. This is done by clicking on the Accept or Reject buttons located next to the “Assigned to” column in the user story table on the Sprint backlog page.

- **Complete task**

  - When the remaining time for a task is 0, the task can be marked as done by clicking on the **Logs** icon and clicking on the **End task** button. This will mark the task as done and the user can no longer log time for the task.
