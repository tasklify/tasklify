## Creating Sprints

Sprints can be created in the current project by SCRUM master on the product backlog page. The form is as follows:

- **Start Date**: Date when the Sprint begins. Must be a future or current date. (Required)
- **End Date**: Date when the Sprint ends. Must be in the future and after the start date. (Required)
- **Velocity**: The expected amount of work (in story points) the team believes can be completed during the Sprint. (Required)
- **Project ID**: Automatically filled based on the project. (Hidden)

After filling out the necessary information, submit the form by clicking on the create button to add the sprint to the current project.

## Edit Sprints

Upcoming sprints can be edited by SCRUM master on the product backlog page. The fields that can be edited as follows:

- **Start Date**: Date when the Sprint begins. Must be a future or current date.
- **End Date**: Date when the Sprint ends. Must be in the future and after the start date.
- **Velocity**: The expected amount of work (in story points) the team believes can be completed during the Sprint.

For sprints that are already active, only the **Velocity field** can be adjusted.

## Delete Sprints

Sprints that have not yet started can be deleted by clicking the **Delete button** next to the sprint's details on the product backlog page.

## Adding user stories to sprint

Stories can be added to a sprint by SCRUM master through the product backlog page.

Adding a new user story to the currently active sprint involves the following steps:

1. **Navigation to backlog**: All available stories not yet assigned to a sprint are listed in the backlog tab, located on the left side of the page.
2. **Story selection**: Stories can be selected through checkboxes. Note that only the stories with a defined time complexity can be selected.
3. **Add to sprint**: After selection, click the "Add to Sprint" button to assign the chosen stories to the currently active sprint. This action moves the stories from the backlog to the sprint view.
4. **Removing from sprint**: Stories that are not yet realized (completed) can be removed from the sprint by clicking the 'X' button within the sprint view, which will return them to the backlog.
