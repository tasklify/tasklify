## Creating Projects

Projects can be created by system admin. After clicking on add new project button, a form opens, which is as follows:

- **Project Title**: Short, descriptive title. (Required and can't be a duplicate)
- **Short Description**: A short description of the project. (Optional)
- **Product Owner**: Select product owner from list of users (Required and can't be the same user as SCRUM master)
- **SCRUM Master**: Select SCRUM master from list of users (Required and can't be the same user as product owner)

After filling out the necessary fields, submit the form by clicking on create button. Then a new dialog will open, in which **Project Developers** can be added to project. The dialog is as follows:

- **Add Project Developers**: Select the desired user and click add, to add that user to the list of project developers.
- **List of Project Developers**: A table that shows all the developers that were added, while there is also an option to remove any of them, by clicking on X button.

A project must have at least one developer before we can continue. When done, click on "I'll add more later" button, to finish the process and close the dialog.

## Editing Projects

Projects can be edited by system admin and scrum master. First thing that can be edited is project info, where project title and description can be changed, following the same rules as on project creation.

The second thing to edit are project members. You can change Product owner and SCRUM master and add or remove project developers. When done, press Save button and users will be saved to project. Note that SCRUM master can also be project developer, but in other cases one user cannot have multiple roles, so if that happens, a warning will be shown and save won't work until you resolve the problem.

## Project Wall

Every user who is a member of the project can access the project wall. There you can see posts from other users, or write one yourself, by clicking on button "Write a new post". You can also edit or delete your existing posts, by hovering over them and choosing one of the actions that show up.
