## Creating Tasks

Tasks can be added to existing user stories within an active Sprint by members of the development team or SCRUM master on the sprint backlog page. The form is as follows:

- **Title**: Short, descriptive title. (Required)
- **Description**: Detailed description of what the task involves. (Optional)
- **Time Estimate**: Time needed to complete the task in hours. Use of decimals for partial hours (e.g., 1.5 for one and a half hours). (Required)
- **User**: Optionally, specify a team member who is suggested to take the task. Note that tasks are not assigned until the team member accepts the task. (Optional)
- **Story ID**: Automatically filled based on the project. (Hidden)
- **Sprint ID**: Automatically filled based on the project. (Hidden)
- **Project ID**: Automatically filled based on the project. (Hidden)

After filling out the necessary information, submit the form by clicking on the create button to add the task to the current user story within the specified Sprint.

## Edit Tasks

Tasks can be edited by project developers and SCRUM master on the sprint backlog page. The fields that can be edited as follows:

- **Title**: Short, descriptive title.
- **Description**: Detailed description of what the task involves.
- **Time Estimate**: Time needed to complete the task in hours. Use of decimals for partial hours (e.g., 1.5 for one and a half hours).

For tasks that are currently unassigned, it is possible to designate a user. However, the assignment is pending until the selected team member accepts or rejects the task.

## Delete Tasks

Tasks that are unassigned and have no logged time can be removed by clicking the **Delete button** next to the task's details on the sprint backlog page.

## Assigning and Unassigning tasks

- **Assign**

  - A task that has no user assigned to it can be taken up by clicking on the **Assign button** next to the "Assigned to" column in the user story tables on the Sprint backlog page. Additionally, a project member can designate any user to a task via the task's creation or edit menu.

- **Unassign**

  - Users already assigned to a task can unassign themselves by selecting the **Unassign button** next to the "Assigned to" column in the user story tables on the Sprint backlog page.

- **Accept/reject**
  - If a user has been assigned to a task by another team member, they can either accept or reject this assignment. This is done by clicking on the **Accept or Reject buttons** located next to the "Assigned to" column in the user story table on the Sprint backlog page.
