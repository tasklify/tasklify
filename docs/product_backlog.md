## Product backlog

The Product Backlog page is accessible to all project members. It is structured into two main sections:

- **Backlog Tab**
    - Located on the left side of the page, this tab contains all unrealized user stories that have not been assigned to a sprint yet.
- **Sprint Views**
    - Positioned on the right, this section features all sprints along with their associated user stories.
    - For each sprint its title (sequence number) and date range are presented.
    - A badge that indicates the current status (Done, Active, or Upcoming) is displayed adjacent to the sprint title.
    - For the currently active sprint, a "Sprint backlog" button is available, providing a direct link to the sprint backlog page.

When a sprint is done, it is moved to the "Done" section, where the completed user stories can be accepted or rejected (with a possibility to add a rejection reason) by the product owner.

#### User stories

Within both the backlog tab and the sprint view, user stories are listed in a table format. The basic information presented is as follows:

- **Title**: Short, descriptive title.
- **Description**: Detailed story explanation.
- **Priority**: Importance of the story (one of the following options: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have this time).
- **Assignment Status**: Indicates whether a team member has been assigned to the story.
- **Realization Status**: Denotes whether the story has been realized.

To the right of each story is a "Details" button which provides access to additional information.
