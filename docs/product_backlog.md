## Product backlog

The Product Backlog page is accessible to all project members. It is structured into two main sections:

- **Backlog Tab**
  - Located on the left side of the page, this tab contains all unrealized user stories that have not been assigned to a sprint yet.
- **Sprint Views**
  - Positioned on the right, this section features all sprints along with their associated user stories.
  - For each sprint its title (sequence number) and date range are presented.
  - A badge that indicates the current status (Done, Active, or Upcoming) is displayed adjacent to the sprint title.
  - For the currently active sprint, a "Sprint backlog" button is available, providing a direct link to the sprint backlog page.

When a sprint is done, it is moved to the "Done" section, where the completed user stories can be accepted or rejected (with a possibility to add a rejection reason) by the product owner.

#### User stories

Within both the backlog tab and the sprint view, user stories are listed in a table format. The basic information presented is as follows:

- **Title**: Short, descriptive title.
- **Description**: Detailed story explanation.
- **Priority**: Importance of the story (one of the following options: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have this time).
- **Assignment Status**: Indicates whether a team member has been assigned to the story.
- **Realization Status**: Denotes whether the story has been realized.

To the right of each story is a "Details" button which provides access to additional information.

#### Commenting On User Story

All project members have access to view and contribute comments on each user story. Within this view, you can read comments from other users, or write one yourself in the bottom part of the dialog. You can also edit or delete your existing comments, by hovering over them and choosing one of the actions that show up.
